Disclaimer:
This crate is currently very early in development and probably nearly unusable for its use-case.

This crate aims to ease the pain of creating simple console applications that require raw-mode from the terminal. e.g. games, text-editors and such.

v. 0.0.2 includes termion now in the package, since it's required for using the crate (for now).
